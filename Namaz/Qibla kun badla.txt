Quran Sureh Baqarah ayat 102:

And so We have made you believers an 
upright community so that you may be 
witnesses over humanity and that the 
Messenger may be a witness over you. We 
assigned your former direction of prayer 
only to distinguish those who would 
remain faithful to the Messenger from 
those who would lose faith. It was 
certainly a difficult test except for 
those rightly guided by Allah. And 
Allah would never discount your previous 
acts of faith. Surely Allah is Ever 
Gracious and Most Merciful to humanity.
