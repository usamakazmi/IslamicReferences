Narrated Ibn Umar: Once a person asked Allah's Apostle about the night prayer. Allah's Apostle replied, The night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on and if anyone is afraid of the approaching dawn (Fajr prayer) he should pray one Raka and this will be a Witr for all the Rakat which he has prayed before.
