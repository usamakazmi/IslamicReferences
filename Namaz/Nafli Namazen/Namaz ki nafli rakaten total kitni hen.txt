According to 1st hadith Prophet(s.a.w) 
used to perform 2 rakat before Zuhar but
in the 2nd hadith it is said that he 
performed 4 rakats, this means that 
he used to pray 4 rakat with 2 salams, 
meaning 2 rakat then 2 rakats(2+2 = 4).

In the light of these hadith the true 
nafli rakats that Prophet never missed 
are 2 before fajr, 4 before zuhar 2 
after zuhar, 2 after magrib, 2 after isha
and 1or3or5or7or9or11or13 witrs

Narrated Ibn 'Umar:

I remember ten Rakat of Nawafil from the 
Prophet, two Rakat before the Zuhr prayer 
and two after it; two Rakat after Maghrib 
prayer in his house, and two Rakat after 
'Isha' prayer in his house, and two Rakat 
before the Fajr prayer and at that time 
nobody would enter the house of the 
Prophet.

Hafsa told me that the Prophet (ﷺ) used 
to offer two Rakat after the call maker 
had made the Adhan and the day had dawned.

Narrated Ibn Umar: Once a person asked 
Allah's Apostle about the night prayer. 
Allah's Apostle replied, The night prayer 
is offered as two Rakat followed by two 
Rakat and so on and if anyone is afraid 
of the approaching dawn (Fajr prayer) he 
should pray one Raka and this will be 
a Witr for all the Rakat which he has 
prayed before.
