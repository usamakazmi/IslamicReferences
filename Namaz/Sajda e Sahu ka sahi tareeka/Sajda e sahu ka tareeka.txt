Narrated `Abdullah bin Buhaina: Allah's Apostle once 
led us in a prayer and offered two rak`at and got up 
(for the third rak`a) without sitting (after the 
second rak`a). The people also got up with him, and 
when he was about to finish his prayer, we waited for 
him to finish the prayer with Taslim but he said 
Takbir before Taslim and performed two prostrations 
while sitting and then finished the prayer with Taslim.
