Yahya related to me from Malik from Abu Nuaym Wahb ibn Kaysan that he heard Jabir ibn Abdullah say, "Someone who prays a raka without reciting the umm al-Qur'an in it has not done the prayer except behind an imam."

Abu Nu'aim Wahb bin Kaisan narated that he heard Jabir bin 'Abdullah saying: Whoever prayed a Rak'ah in which he did not recite Umm Al-Qur'an, then he did not pray except if he was behind an Imam. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih.
