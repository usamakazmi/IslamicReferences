Ahadith Against Rafayadain

Quran Ali 'Imran:61(3:61) 
Lanat ullah ilal Kazibeen ul Munafiqeen
لعنت اللہ الا لکازبین المنافقین,
JHOOT BOLNE WALON AUR MUNAFIQON PAR 
ALLAH KI LANAT
Invoke Curse of Allah upon Liars and 
Hypocrites

ASH-HADU ANN LA ILAHA 
ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA 
MUHAMMADAN RASULU ALLAH

I bear witness that no one deserves 
to be worshiped except Allah and I 
bear witness that Muhammad is the 
Messenger of Allah

---------------------------------------------
Why Muslims are divided in firqas, God forbid 
me saying this but did Allah, his rasool and 
sahabas failed to protect the true way of 
Muhammad(s.a.w)?

The Answer is simple Allah puts everyone 
through a test, the test of Sahaba was 
different then Tabaeen, Tabaeen's test 
was different than the next gen and 
similarly our test is different than theirs.
Those who got Islam in heritage don't value
it enough thus finding the truth is duty of 
every Muslim, every Muslim will eventually 
enter Jannah but after their punishments, 
people who blindly follow their ancestors 
will without a doubt be punished before 
entering Jannah. May Allah show us the 
right path.

Ale Imran 3:142
Do you think you will enter Paradise without 
Allah proving which of you ˹truly˺ struggled 
˹for His cause˺ and patiently endured?

---------------------------------------------
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, 
the Most Merciful.
All the praises and thanks be to Allah, 
the Lord of the world. (mankind, jinns 
and all that exists).
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgement.
You (Alone) we worship, and you (Alone) 
we ask for help (for each and everything).
Guide us to the Straight Way
The Way of those on whom You have bestowed 
Your Grace, not (the way) of those who 
earned Your Anger, nor of those who went 
astray.
---------------------------------------------
Anyone who associates a lie to 
Muhammad(s.a.w) will definitely meet 
Allah's wrath on the day of Judgement.

ahadith Ameen.

Sahih Bukhari Hadith No. 828
Chapter 11: The Book Of Adhan(Sufa-Tus-Salat)
Book	Sahih Bukhari
Hadith No	828
Baab: Azaan Ke Masail Ke 
Bayan Main - Sufa-Tus-Salat

Narrated Muhammad bin `Amr bin `Ata': I was 
sitting with some of the companions of Allah's
Apostle and we were discussing about the way 
of praying of the Prophet. Abu Humaid As-Sa`idi
said, I remember the prayer of Allah's Apostle 
better than any one of you. I saw him raising 
both his hands up to the level of the 
shoulders on saying the Takbir; and on bowing 
he placed his hands on both knees and bent 
his back straight, then he stood up straight 
from bowing till all the vertebrate took their 
normal positions. In prostrations, he placed 
both his hands on the ground with the forearms 
away from the ground and away from his body, 
and his toes were facing the Qibla. On sitting 
In the second rak`a he sat on his left foot 
and propped up the right one; and in the last 
rak`a he pushed his left foot forward and kept 
the other foot propped up and sat over the 
buttocks.

---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------
!!!Note: Even though these ahadith are in 
book of prayer but the chapter is of takbeer 
thats why even at the start of namaz no 
mention of rafayadain
---------------------------------------------

Muslim 867-book of prayers-chapter of takbeer

Abu Salama reported: Abu Huraira led prayer
for them and recited takbir when he bent 
and raised himself (in ruku' and sujud) 
and after completing (the prayer) he said: 
By Allah I say prayer which has the best 
resemblance with the prayer of the Prophet 
( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) amongst you.

Bukhari 803-book of prayers-chapter of takbeer

Narrated Abu Bakr bin `Abdur Rahman Ibn Harith 
bin Hisham and Abu Salama bin `Abdur Rahman: 
Abu Huraira used to say Takbir in all the 
prayers, compulsory and optional -- in the 
month of Ramadan or other months. He used 
to say Takbir on standing for prayer and on 
bowing; then he would say, Sami`a l-lahu liman 
hamidah, and before prostrating he would say 
Rabbana wa laka lhamd. Then he would say Takbir 
on prostrating and on raising his head from the 
prostration, then another Takbir on prostrating 
(for the second time), and on raising his head 
from the prostration. He also would say the 
Takbir on standing from the second rak`a. He 
used to do the same in every rak`a till he 
completed the prayer. On completion of the 
prayer, he would say, By Him in Whose Hands 
my soul is! No doubt my prayer is closer to 
that of Allah's Apostle than yours, and this 
was His prayer till he left this world.
