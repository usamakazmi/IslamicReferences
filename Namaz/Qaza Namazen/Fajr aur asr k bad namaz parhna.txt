Quran Ali 'Imran:61(3:61) 
Lanat ullah ilal Kazibeen ul Munafiqeen
لعنت اللہ الا لکازبین المنافقین,
JHOOT BOLNE WALON AUR MUNAFIQON PAR

ASH-HADU ANN LA ILAHA 
ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA 
MUHAMMADAN RASULU ALLAH

I bear witness that no one deserves 
to be worshiped except Allah and I 
bear witness that Muhammad is the 
Messenger of Allah

---------------------------------------------
Why Muslims are divided in firqas, God forbid 
me saying this but did Allah, his rasool and 
sahabas failed to protect the true way of 
Muhammad(s.a.w)?

The Answer is simple Allah puts everyone 
through a test, the test of Sahaba was 
different then Tabaeen, Tabaeen's test 
was different than the next gen and 
similarly our test is different than theirs.
Those who got Islam in heritage don't value
it enough thus finding the truth is duty of 
every Muslim, every Muslim will eventually 
enter Jannah but after their punishments, 
people who blindly follow their ancestors 
will without a doubt be punished before 
entering Jannah. May Allah show us the 
right path.

Ale Imran 3:142
Do you think you will enter Paradise without 
Allah proving which of you ˹truly˺ struggled 
˹for His cause˺ and patiently endured?

---------------------------------------------
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, 
the Most Merciful.
All the praises and thanks be to Allah, 
the Lord of the world. (mankind, jinns 
and all that exists).
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgement.
You (Alone) we worship, and you (Alone) 
we ask for help (for each and everything).
Guide us to the Straight Way
The Way of those on whom You have bestowed 
Your Grace, not (the way) of those who 
earned Your Anger, nor of those who went 
astray.
---------------------------------------------
Anyone who associates a lie to 
Muhammad(s.a.w) will definitely meet 
Allah's wrath on the day of Judgement.

Chapter 23 The Book Of As-Sahw (Forgetting)
Book	Sahih Bukhari
Hadith No	1233
Baab	Sajda Sahu Ka Bayan

Narrated Kuraib: I was sent to Aisha by 
Ibn `Abbas, Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and 
`Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar . They told me to 
greet her on their behalf and to ask her 
about the offering of the two rak`at 
after the `Asr prayer and to say to her, 
We were informed that you offer those two 
rak`at and we were told that the Prophet 
had forbidden offering them. Ibn `Abbas 
said, I along with `Umar bin Al-Khattab 
used to beat the people whenever they 
offered them. I went to Aisha and told 
her that message. `Aisha said, Go and 
ask Um Salama about them. So I returned 
and informed them about her statement. 
They then told me to go to Um Salama with 
the same question with which t sent me to 
`Aisha. Um Salama replied, I heard the 
Prophet forbidding them. Later I saw him 
offering them immediately after he prayed 
the `Asr prayer. He then entered my house 
at a time when some of the Ansari women 
from the tribe of Bani Haram were sitting 
with me, so I sent my slave girl to him 
having said to her, 'Stand beside him and 
tell him that Um Salama says to you, O 
Allah's Apostle! I have heard you 
forbidding the offering of these (two 
rak`at after the `Asr prayer) but I have 
seen you offering them. If he waves his 
hand then wait for him.' The slave girl 
did that. The Prophet beckoned her with 
his hand and she waited for him. When he 
had finished the prayer he said, O 
daughter of Bani Umaiya! You have asked 
me about the two rak`at after the `Asr 
prayer. The people of the tribe of 
`Abdul-Qais came to me and made me busy 
and I could not offer the two rak`at 
after the Zuhr prayer. These (two rak`at 
that I have just prayed) are for those 
(missed) ones.
