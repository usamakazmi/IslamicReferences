Muslims in Yemen vs Mushrik in Makkah - Muslims lose
March 23 625AD

Archers were ordered to stay in their positions
when muslims started to win and archers saw the maal
e ganimat then disobeyed Prophet by leaving their positions
ultimately Muslims lost.

Hazrat Hamzah(R.A) is Killed by Wahshi ibn Harb(R.A)

Hazrat Ali goes 1v1 again and wins but lets the mushrik live

Allah later forgives these people in Quran.


Khalid bin Waleed and Amr bin as still non muslims
