' A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that 
Sahla bint Suhail came to Allah's Apostle (
may peace be eupon him) and said:

Messengerof Allah, I see on the face of Abu Hudhaifa 
(signs of disgust) on entering of Salim (who is an 
ally) into (our house), whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) 
said: Suckle him. She said: How can I suckle him as 
he is a grown-up man? Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled 
and said: I already know that he is a young man 'Amr 
has made this addition in his narration that he 
participated in the Battle of Badr and in the 
narration of Ibn 'Umar (the words are): Allah's 
Messenger (ﷺ) laughed.

'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that 
Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hadhaifa, lived 
with him and his family in their house. She (i. 
e. the daughter of Suhail came to Allah's Apostle 
(ﷺ) and said:

Salim has attained (purbety) as men attain, and 
he understands what they understand, and he enters
 our house freely, I, however, perceive that 
something (rankles) in the heart of Abu Hudhaifa, 
whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said to her: Suckle 
him and you would become unlawful for him, and 
(the rankling) which Abu Hudhaifa feels in his 
heart will disappear. She returned and said: So I 
suckled him, and what (was there) in the heart of 
Abu Hudhaifa disappeared.

Umm Salama, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), used to 
say that all wives of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) disclaimed 
the idea that one with this type of fosterage (having 
been suckled after the proper period) should come to 
them. and said to 'A'isha:

By Allah, we do not find this but a sort of concession 
given by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) only for Salim, and 
no one was going to be allowed to enter (our houses) 
with this type of fosterage and we do not subscribe 
to this view.

Ibn Abu Mulaika reported that al-Qasim b. Muhammad 
b. Abu Bakr had narrated to him that 'A'isha (Allah 
be pleased with her) reported that Sahla bint Suhail 
b. 'Amr came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said:

Messenger of Allah, Salim (the freed slave of Abu 
Hudhaifa) is living with us in our house, and he 
has attained (puberty) as men attain it and has 
acquired knowledge (of the sex problems) as men 
acquire, whereupon he said: Suckle him so that he 
may become unlawful (in regard to marriage) for you 
He (Ibn Abu Mulaika) said: I refrained from 
(narrating this hadith) for a year or so on account 
of fear. I then met al-Qasim and said to him: You 
narrated to me a hadith which I did not narrate (to 
anyone) afterwards. He said: What is that? I informed 
him, whereupon he said: Narrate it on my authority 
that 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) had narrated 
that to me.

Umm Salama said to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her):

A young boy who is at the threshold of puberty comes to 
you. I, however, do not like that he should come to me, 
whereupon 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: 
Don't you see in Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) a model for 
you? She also said: The wife of Abu Hudhaifa said: 
Messenger of Allah, Salim comes to me and now he is 
a (grown-up) person, and there is something that 
(rankles) in the mind of Abu Hudhaifa about him, 
whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Suckle him (so 
that he may become your foster-child), and thus he 
may be able to come to you (freely).

Zainab daughter of Abu Salama reported:

I heard Umm Salama, the wife of Allah's Apostle (may 
peace be upon himy, saying to 'A'isha: By Allah, I do 
not like to be seen by a young boy who has passed the 
period of fosterage, whereupon she ('A'isha) said: Why 
is it so? Sahla daughter of Suhail came to Allah's 
Messenger (ﷺ) and said: Allah's Messenger, I swear 
by Allah that I see in the face of Abu Hudhaifa (the 
signs of disgust) on account of entering of Salim (in 
the house), whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: 
Suckle him. She (Sahla bint Suhail) said: He has a 
heard. But he (again) said: Suckle him, and it would 
remove what is there (expression of disgust) on the 
face of Abu Hudhaifa. She said: (I did that) and, by 
Allah, I did not see (any sign of disgust) on the 
face of Abu Hudhaifa.
