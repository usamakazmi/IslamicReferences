Baab	Nikah Ke Ehkaam O Masail

Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) 
reported that a man came to Allah's 
Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and 
said: I have a slave-girl who is 
our servant and she carries water 
for us and I have intercourse with 
her, but I do not want her to 
conceive. He said: Practise 'azl, 
if you so like, but what is decreed 
for her will come to her. The person 
stayed back (for some time) and 
then came and said: The girl has 
become pregnant, whereupon he said: 
I told you what was decreed for her 
would come to her.
