Ayat/Ahadith

Quran Ali 'Imran:61(3:61) 
Lanat ullah ilal Kazibeen ul Munafiqeen
لعنت اللہ الا لکازبین المنافقین,
JHOOT BOLNE WALON AUR MUNAFIQON PAR

Invoke Curse of Allah upon Liars and

ASH-HADU ANN LA ILAHA 
ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA 
MUHAMMADAN RASULU ALLAH

I bear witness that no one deserves 
to be worshiped except Allah and I 
bear witness that Muhammad is the 
Messenger of Allah

---------------------------------------------
Why Muslims are divided in firqas, God forbid 
me saying this but did Allah, his rasool and 
sahabas failed to protect the true way of 
Muhammad(s.a.w)?

The Answer is simple Allah puts everyone 
through a test, the test of Sahaba was 
different then Tabaeen, Tabaeen's test 
was different than the next gen and 
similarly our test is different than theirs.
Those who got Islam in heritage don't value
it enough thus finding the truth is duty of 
every Muslim, every Muslim will eventually 
enter Jannah but after their punishments, 
people who blindly follow their ancestors 
will without a doubt be punished before 
entering Jannah. May Allah show us the 
right path.

Ale Imran 3:142
Do you think you will enter Paradise without 
Allah proving which of you ˹truly˺ struggled 
˹for His cause˺ and patiently endured?

---------------------------------------------
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, 
the Most Merciful.
All the praises and thanks be to Allah, 
the Lord of the world. (mankind, jinns 
and all that exists).
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgement.
You (Alone) we worship, and you (Alone) 
we ask for help (for each and everything).
Guide us to the Straight Way
The Way of those on whom You have bestowed 
Your Grace, not (the way) of those who 
earned Your Anger, nor of those who went 
astray.
---------------------------------------------
Anyone who associates a lie to 
Muhammad(s.a.w) will definitely meet 
Allah's wrath on the day of Judgement.

Narrated Anas bin Malik:

I was ten years old when Allah's Messenger 
(ﷺ) arrived at Medina. My mother and aunts 
used to urge me to serve the Prophet (ﷺ) 
regularly, and I served him for ten years. 
When the Prophet (ﷺ) died I was twenty years 
old, and I knew about the order of Al-Hijab 
(veiling of ladies) more than any other person 
when it was revealed. It was revealed for the 
first time when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had 
consummated his marriage with Zainab bint 
Jahsh. When the day dawned, the Prophet (ﷺ) 
was a bridegroom and he invited the people to 
a banquet, so they came, ate, and then all 
left except a few who remained with the 
Prophet (ﷺ) for a long time. The Prophet 
(ﷺ) got up and went out, and I too went out 
with him so that those people might leave 
too. The Prophet (ﷺ) proceeded and so did I,
 till he came to the threshold of `Aisha's 
dwelling place. Then thinking that these 
people have left by then, he returned and 
so did I along with him till he entered upon 
Zainab and behold, they were still sitting 
and had not gone. So the Prophet (ﷺ) again 
went away and I went away along with him. 
When we reached the threshold of `Aisha's 
dwelling place, he thought that they had 
left, and so he returned and I too, returned 
along with him and found those people had 
left. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) drew a curtain 
between me and him, and the Verses of 
Al-Hijab were revealed.
