Quran 4:22

Do not marry former wives of your 
fathers—except what was done previously. 
It was indeed a shameful, despicable, and 
evil practice.

-------------------------------------------
Quran 4:23

˹Also˺ forbidden to you for marriage are 
your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, 
your paternal and maternal aunts, your 
brother’s daughters, your sister’s 
daughters, your foster-mothers, your 
foster-sisters, your mothers-in-law, your 
stepdaughters under your guardianship if 
you have consummated marriage with their 
mothers—but if you have not, then you can 
marry them—nor the wives of your own sons, 
nor two sisters together at the same 
time—except what was done previously. 
Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most 
Merciful.

-------------------------------------------
Quran 4:24

Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except 
˹female˺ captives in your possession. 
This is Allah’s commandment to you. 
Lawful to you are all beyond these—as 
long as you seek them with your wealth 
in a legal marriage, not in fornication. 
Give those you have consummated marriage 
with their due dowries. It is permissible 
to be mutually gracious regarding the set 
dowry. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, 
All-Wise.

Narrated Abu Huraira:

The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade that a woman should 
be married to a man along with her paternal 
aunt or with her maternal aunt (at the same 
time). Az-Zuhri (the sub-narrator) said: 
There is a similar order for the paternal 
aunt of the father of one's wife, for 'Urwa 
told me that `Aisha said, "What is unlawful 
because of blood relations, is also unlawful 
because of the corresponding foster suckling 
relations."
