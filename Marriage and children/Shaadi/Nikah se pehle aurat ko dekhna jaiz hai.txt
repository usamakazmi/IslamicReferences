ASH-HADU ANN LA ILAHA 
ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA 
MUHAMMADAN RASULU ALLAH

I bear witness that no one deserves 
to be worshiped except Allah and I 
bear witness that Muhammad is the 
Messenger of Allah

---------------------------------------------
Why Muslims are divided in firqas, God forbid 
me saying this but did Allah, his rasool and 
sahabas failed to protect the true way of 
Muhammad(s.a.w)?

The Answer is simple Allah puts everyone 
through a test, the test of Sahaba was 
different then Tabaeen, Tabaeen's test 
was different than the next gen and 
similarly our test is different than theirs.
Those who got Islam in heritage don't value
it enough thus finding the truth is duty of 
every Muslim, every Muslim will eventually 
enter Jannah but after their punishments, 
people who blindly follow their ancestors 
will without a doubt be punished before 
entering Jannah. May Allah show us the 
right path.

Ale Imran 3:142
Do you think you will enter Paradise without 
Allah proving which of you ˹truly˺ struggled 
˹for His cause˺ and patiently endured?

---------------------------------------------
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, 
the Most Merciful.
All the praises and thanks be to Allah, 
the Lord of the world. (mankind, jinns 
and all that exists).
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgement.
You (Alone) we worship, and you (Alone) 
we ask for help (for each and everything).
Guide us to the Straight Way
The Way of those on whom You have bestowed 
Your Grace, not (the way) of those who 
earned Your Anger, nor of those who went 
astray.
---------------------------------------------
Anyone who associates a lie to 
Muhammad(s.a.w) will definitely meet 
Allah's wrath on the day of Judgement.

Narrated `Aisha:

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to me), "You 
were shown to me in a dream. An angel brought 
you to me, wrapped in a piece of silken cloth, 
and said to me, 'This is your wife.' I removed 
the piece of cloth from your face, and there 
you were. I said to myself. 'If it is from 
Allah, then it will surely be.' "

Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:

A woman came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and 
said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have come 
to you to present myself to you (for 
marriage)." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) glanced 
at her. He looked at her carefully and fixed 
his glance on her and then lowered his head. 
When the lady saw that he did not say 
anything, she sat down. A man from his 
companions got up and said, "O Allah's 
Messenger (ﷺ)! If you are not in need of 
her, then marry her to me." The Prophet (ﷺ) 
said, "Have you got anything to offer." The man 
said, 'No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" 
The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "Go to your 
family and try to find something." So the man 
went and returned, saying, "No, by Allah, O 
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have not found 
anything." The Prophet said, "Go again and look 
for something, even if it were an iron ring." 
He went and returned, saying, "No, by Allah, O 
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I could not find even 
an iron ring, but this is my Izar (waist sheet).' 
He had no Rida (upper garment). He added, "I 
give half of it to her." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) 
said "What will she do with your Izar? If you 
wear it, she will have nothing over herself 
thereof (will be naked); and if she wears it, 
then you will have nothing over yourself thereof ' 
So the man sat for a long period and then got up 
(to leave). When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw him 
leaving, he ordered that he e called back. When 
he came, the Prophet (ﷺ) asked (him), "How much 
of the Qur'an do you know (by heart)?" The man 
replied, I know such Sura and such Sura and such 
Sura," naming the suras. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 
"Can you recite it by heart?" He said, 'Yes." 
The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Go I let you marry her 
for what you know of the Qur'an (as her Mahr).
