Jahnnam main zydatar auraten hngi kunke wo 
apne shohar ki shukarguzar nae ko sabit 
karne wali chand Ayat/Ahadith

Quran Ali 'Imran:61(3:61) 
Lanat ullah ilal Kazibeen ul Munafiqeen
لعنت اللہ الا لکازبین المنافقین,
JHOOT BOLNE WALON AUR MUNAFIQON PAR 
ALLAH KI LANAT
Invoke Curse of Allah upon Liars and 
Hypocrites

---------------------------------------------
ASH-HADU ANN LA ILAHA 
ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA 
MUHAMMADAN RASULU ALLAH

I bear witness that no one deserves 
to be worshiped except Allah and I 
bear witness that Muhammad is the 
Messenger of Allah

---------------------------------------------
Why Muslims are divided in firqas, God forbid 
me saying this but did Allah, his rasool and 
sahabas failed to protect the true way of 
Muhammad(s.a.w)?

The Answer is simple Allah puts everyone 
through a test, the test of Sahaba was 
different then Tabaeen, Tabaeen's test 
was different than the next gen and 
similarly our test is different than theirs.
Those who got Islam in heritage don't value
it enough thus finding the truth is duty of 
every Muslim, every Muslim will eventually 
enter Jannah but after their punishments, 
people who blindly follow their ancestors 
will without a doubt be punished before 
entering Jannah. May Allah show us the 
right path.

Ale Imran 3:142
Do you think you will enter Paradise without 
Allah proving which of you ˹truly˺ struggled 
˹for His cause˺ and patiently endured?

---------------------------------------------
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, 
the Most Merciful.
All the praises and thanks be to Allah, 
the Lord of the world. (mankind, jinns 
and all that exists).
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgement.
You (Alone) we worship, and you (Alone) 
we ask for help (for each and everything).
Guide us to the Straight Way
The Way of those on whom You have bestowed 
Your Grace, not (the way) of those who 
earned Your Anger, nor of those who went 
astray.
---------------------------------------------
Anyone who associates a lie to 
Muhammad(s.a.w) will definitely meet 
Allah's wrath on the day of Judgement.

Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas:

During the lifetime of Allah's Messenger 
(ﷺ), the sun eclipsed. Allah's Messenger 
(ﷺ) offered the prayer of (the) eclipse) 
and so did the people along with him. He 
performed a long Qiyam (standing posture) 
during which Surat-al-Baqara could have been 
recited; then he performed a pro-longed 
bowing, then raised his head and stood for a 
long time which was slightly less than that 
of the first Qiyam (and recited Qur'an). 
Then he performed a prolonged bowing again 
but the period was shorter than the period 
of the first bowing, then he stood up and 
then prostrated. Again he stood up, but this 
time the period of standing was less than the 
first standing. Then he performed a prolonged 
bowing but of a lesser duration than the first, 
then he stood up again for a long time but for 
a lesser duration than the first. Then he 
performed a prolonged bowing but of lesser 
duration than the first, and then he again 
stood up, and then prostrated and then 
finished his prayer. By then the sun eclipse 
had cleared. The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, 
"The sun and the moon are two signs among the 
signs of Allah, and they do not eclipse 
because of the death or birth of someone, so 
when you observe the eclipse, remember Allah 
(offer the eclipse prayer)." They (the 
people) said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We 
saw you stretching your hand to take something 
at this place of yours, then we saw you 
stepping backward." He said, "I saw Paradise 
(or Paradise was shown to me), and I stretched 
my hand to pluck a bunch (of grapes), and had 
I plucked it, you would have eaten of it as 
long as this world exists. Then I saw the 
(Hell) Fire, and I have never before, seen 
such a horrible sight as that, and I saw that 
the majority of its dwellers were women." The 
people asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What 
is the reason for that?" He replied, "Because 
of their ungratefulness." It was said. "Do 
they disbelieve in Allah (are they ungrateful 
to Allah)?" He replied, "They are not 
thankful to their husbands and are ungrateful 
for the favors done to them. Even if you do 
good to one of them all your life, when she 
seems some harshness from you, she will say, 
"I have never seen any good from you.' "

Fire were ordered to be taken to the Fire. 
Then I stood at the gate of the Fire and
