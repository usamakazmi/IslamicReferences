ASH-HADU ANN LA ILAHA 
ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA 
MUHAMMADAN RASULU ALLAH

I bear witness that no one deserves 
to be worshiped except Allah and I 
bear witness that Muhammad is the 
Messenger of Allah

---------------------------------------------
Why Muslims are divided in firqas, God forbid 
me saying this but did Allah, his rasool and 
sahabas failed to protect the true way of 
Muhammad(s.a.w)?

The Answer is simple Allah puts everyone 
through a test, the test of Sahaba was 
different then Tabaeen, Tabaeen's test 
was different than the next gen and 
similarly our test is different than theirs.
Those who got Islam in heritage don't value
it enough thus finding the truth is duty of 
every Muslim, every Muslim will eventually 
enter Jannah but after their punishments, 
people who blindly follow their ancestors 
will without a doubt be punished before 
entering Jannah. May Allah show us the 
right path.

Ale Imran 3:142
Do you think you will enter Paradise without 
Allah proving which of you ˹truly˺ struggled 
˹for His cause˺ and patiently endured?

---------------------------------------------
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, 
the Most Merciful.
All the praises and thanks be to Allah, 
the Lord of the world. (mankind, jinns 
and all that exists).
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgement.
You (Alone) we worship, and you (Alone) 
we ask for help (for each and everything).
Guide us to the Straight Way
The Way of those on whom You have bestowed 
Your Grace, not (the way) of those who 
earned Your Anger, nor of those who went 
astray.
---------------------------------------------
Anyone who associates a lie to 
Muhammad(s.a.w) will definitely meet 
Allah's wrath on the day of Judgement.

Quran 2:233(Sureh Baqarah Ayat 233)

˹Divorced˺ mothers will breastfeed their 
offspring for two whole years, for those 
who wish to complete the nursing ˹of their 
child˺. The child’s father will provide 
reasonable maintenance and clothing for 
the mother ˹during that period˺. No one 
will be charged with more than they can 
bear. No mother or father should be made 
to suffer for their child. The ˹father’s˺ 
heirs are under the same obligation. But 
if both sides decide—after mutual 
consultation and consent—to wean a child, 
then there is no blame on them. If you 
decide to have your children nursed by a 
wet-nurse, it is permissible as long as 
you pay fairly. Be mindful of Allah, and 
know that Allah is All-Seeing of what you 
do.

Baab	Nikah Ke Masail Ka Bayan

Narrated `Aisha: that the Prophet entered upon 
her while a man was sitting with her. Signs of 
answer seemed to appear on his face as if he 
disliked that. She said, Here is my (foster) 
brother. He said, Be sure as to who is your 
foster brother, for foster suckling 
relationship is established only when milk 
is the only food of the child.
