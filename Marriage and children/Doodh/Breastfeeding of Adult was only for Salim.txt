------------------------------------------------------
' A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that 
Sahla bint Suhail came to Allah's Apostle (
may peace be eupon him) and said:

Messengerof Allah, I see on the face of Abu Hudhaifa 
(signs of disgust) on entering of Salim (who is an 
ally) into (our house), whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) 
said: Suckle him. She said: How can I suckle him as 
he is a grown-up man? Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled 
and said: I already know that he is a young man 'Amr 
has made this addition in his narration that he 
participated in the Battle of Badr and in the 
narration of Ibn 'Umar (the words are): Allah's 
Messenger (ﷺ) laughed.

'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that 
Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hadhaifa, lived 
with him and his family in their house. She (i. 
e. the daughter of Suhail came to Allah's Apostle 
(ﷺ) and said:

Salim has attained (purbety) as men attain, and 
he understands what they understand, and he enters
 our house freely, I, however, perceive that 
something (rankles) in the heart of Abu Hudhaifa, 
whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said to her: Suckle 
him and you would become unlawful for him, and 
(the rankling) which Abu Hudhaifa feels in his 
heart will disappear. She returned and said: So I 
suckled him, and what (was there) in the heart of 
Abu Hudhaifa disappeared.

Umm Salama, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), used to 
say that all wives of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) disclaimed 
the idea that one with this type of fosterage (having 
been suckled after the proper period) should come to 
them. and said to 'A'isha:

By Allah, we do not find this but a sort of concession 
given by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) only for Salim, and 
no one was going to be allowed to enter (our houses) 
with this type of fosterage and we do not subscribe 
to this view.
