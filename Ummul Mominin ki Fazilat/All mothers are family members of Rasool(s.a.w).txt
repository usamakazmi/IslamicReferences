Quran Sureh Ahzab 33:29-34

33:29
But if you desire Allah and 
His Messenger and the 
˹everlasting˺ Home of the 
Hereafter, then Surely Allah 
has prepared a great reward 
for those of you who do good.

33:30
O wives of the Prophet! If 
any of you were to commit a 
blatant misconduct, the 
punishment would be doubled 
for her. And that is easy 
for Allah.

33:31
And whoever of you devoutly 
obeys Allah and His Messenger 
and does good, We will grant 
her double the reward, and We 
have prepared for her an 
honourable provision.

33:32
O wives of the Prophet! You 
are not like any other women: 
if you are mindful of Allah, 
then do not be overly 
effeminate in speech with 
men or those with sickness in 
their hearts may be tempted, 
but speak in a moderate tone.

33:33
Settle in your homes, and do 
not display yourselves as 
women did in the days of 
pre-Islamic ignorance. 
Establish prayer, pay alms-tax, 
and obey Allah and His Messenger. 
Allah only intends to keep the 
causes of evil away from you 
and purify you completely, O 
members of the Prophet’s family!

33:34
Always remember what is recited 
in your homes of Allah’s 
revelations and prophetic 
wisdom.1 Surely Allah is Most 
Subtle, All-Aware.
