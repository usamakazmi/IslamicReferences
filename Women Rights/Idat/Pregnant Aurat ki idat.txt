Quran 65:4 Sureh Talaq

As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do 
not know, their waiting period is three months, and those who 
have not menstruated as well. As for those who are pregnant, 
their waiting period ends with delivery. And whoever is 
mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.

Baab	Talaq Ke Ehkaam O Masail

Abu Salama b. 'Abd al-Rahman and Ibn 'Abbas. 
(Allah be pleased with them) got together 
in the house of Abu Huraira (Allah be 
pleased with him) and began to discuss 
about the woman who gave birth to a child 
a few nights after the death of her husband. 
Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with then) ) 
said: Her 'Idda is that period which is 
longer of the two (between four months and 
ten days and the birth of the child, whichever 
is longer). AbuSalama, however said: Her 
period of 'Idda is over (with the birth of 
the child), and they were contending with 
each other over this issue, whereupon Abu 
Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) said: 
I subscribe (to the view) held by my 
nephew (i. e. Abu Salama). They sent Kuraib 
(the freed slave of Ibn 'Abbas) to Umm 
Salama to ask her about it. He came (back) 
to them and informed them that Umm Salama 
(Allah be pleased with her) said that Subai'ah 
al-Aslamiyya gave birth to a child after the 
death of her husband when the few flights (had 
hardly) passed and she made mention of that 
to Allah's Messenger ( ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) and 
he commanded her to marry.
