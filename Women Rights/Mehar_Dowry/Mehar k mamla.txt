Ayat/Ahadith in support of A reasonable 
compensation after divorce is an obligation.

was decided then paying half of mehar is
mandatory(unless wife waives it or husband 
wants to pay in full).

ASH-HADU ANN LA ILAHA 
ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA 
MUHAMMADAN RASULU ALLAH

I bear witness that no one deserves 
to be worshiped except Allah and I 
bear witness that Muhammad is the 
Messenger of Allah

Why Muslims are divided in firqas, God forbid 
me saying this but did Allah, his rasool and 
sahabas failed to protect the true way of 
Muhammad(s.a.w)?

The Answer is simple Allah puts everyone 
through a test, the test of Sahaba was 
different then Tabaeen, Tabaeen's test 
was different than the next gen and 
similarly our test is different than theirs.
Those who got Islam in heritage don't value
it enough thus finding the truth is duty of 
every Muslim, every Muslim will eventually 
enter Jannah but after their punishments, 
people who blindly follow their ancestors 
will without a doubt be punished before 
entering Jannah. May Allah show us the 
right path.

Ale Imran 3:142
Do you think you will enter Paradise without 
Allah proving which of you ˹truly˺ struggled 
˹for His cause˺ and patiently endured?

---------------------------------------------
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, 
the Most Merciful.
All the praises and thanks be to Allah, 
the Lord of the world. (mankind, jinns 
and all that exists).
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgement.
You (Alone) we worship, and you (Alone) 
we ask for help (for each and everything).
Guide us to the Straight Way
The Way of those on whom You have bestowed 
Your Grace, not (the way) of those who 
earned Your Anger, nor of those who went 
astray.
---------------------------------------------
Anyone who associates a lie to 
Muhammad(s.a.w) will definitely meet 
Allah's wrath on the day of Judgement.

Quran 2:236-237

There is no blame if you divorce women 
before the marriage is consummated or 
the dowry is settled. But give them a 
˹suitable˺ compensation—the rich according 
to his means and the poor according to his. 
A reasonable compensation is an obligation 
on the good-doers.

And if you divorce them before consummating 
the marriage but after deciding on a dowry, 
pay half of the dowry, unless the wife 
graciously waives it or the husband graciously 
pays in full. Graciousness is closer to 
righteousness. And do not forget kindness 
among yourselves. Surely Allah is All-Seeing 
of what you do.

---------------------------------------------
Quran 4:4

Give women ˹you wed˺ their due dowries 
graciously. But if they waive some of it 
willingly, then you may enjoy it freely with 
a clear conscience.
