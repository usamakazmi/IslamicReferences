Ayat/Ahadith

Quran Ali 'Imran:61(3:61) 
Lanat ullah ilal Kazibeen ul Munafiqeen
لعنت اللہ الا لکازبین المنافقین,
JHOOT BOLNE WALON AUR MUNAFIQON PAR 
ALLAH KI LANAT
Invoke Curse of Allah upon Liars and 
Hypocrites

---------------------------------------------
ASH-HADU ANN LA ILAHA 
ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA 
MUHAMMADAN RASULU ALLAH

I bear witness that no one deserves 
to be worshiped except Allah and I 
bear witness that Muhammad is the 
Messenger of Allah

---------------------------------------------
Why Muslims are divided in firqas, God forbid 
me saying this but did Allah, his rasool and 
sahabas failed to protect the true way of 
Muhammad(s.a.w)?

The Answer is simple Allah puts everyone 
through a test, the test of Sahaba was 
different then Tabaeen, Tabaeen's test 
was different than the next gen and 
similarly our test is different than theirs.
Those who got Islam in heritage don't value
it enough thus finding the truth is duty of 
every Muslim, every Muslim will eventually 
enter Jannah but after their punishments, 
people who blindly follow their ancestors 
will without a doubt be punished before 
entering Jannah. May Allah show us the 
right path.

Ale Imran 3:142
Do you think you will enter Paradise without 
Allah proving which of you ˹truly˺ struggled 
˹for His cause˺ and patiently endured?

---------------------------------------------
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, 
the Most Merciful.
All the praises and thanks be to Allah, 
the Lord of the world. (mankind, jinns 
and all that exists).
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgement.
You (Alone) we worship, and you (Alone) 
we ask for help (for each and everything).
Guide us to the Straight Way
The Way of those on whom You have bestowed 
Your Grace, not (the way) of those who 
earned Your Anger, nor of those who went 
astray.
---------------------------------------------
Anyone who associates a lie to 
Muhammad(s.a.w) will definitely meet 
Allah's wrath on the day of Judgement.

Narrated Thabit Al-Banani:

I was with Anas while his daughter was 
present with him. Anas said, "A woman came 
to Allah's Apostle and presented herself to 
him, saying, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), have 
you any need for me (i.e. would you like to 
marry me)?' "Thereupon Anas's daughter said, 
"What a shameless lady she was ! Shame! 
Shame!" Anas said, "She was better than you; 
she had a liking for the Prophet (ﷺ) so 
she presented herself for marriage to him."

Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:

A woman presented herself to the Prophet 
(for marriage). A man said to him, "O 
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (If you are not in 
need of her) marry her to me." The Prophet 
(ﷺ) said, "What have you got?" The man said, 
"I have nothing." The Prophet (ﷺ) said 
(to him), "Go and search for something) even 
if it were an iron ring." The man went and 
returned saying, "No, I have not found 
anything, not even an iron ring; but this 
is my (Izar) waist sheet, and half of it 
is for her." He had no Rida' (upper garment). 
The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "What will she do with 
your waist sheet? If you wear it, she will 
have nothing over her; and if she wears it, 
you will have nothing over you." So the man 
sat down and when he had sat a long time, he 
got up (to leave). When the Prophet (ﷺ) saw 
him (leaving), he called him back, or the man 
was called (for him), and he said to the man, 
"How much of the Qur'an do you know (by 
heart)?" The man replied I know such Sura 
and such Sura (by heart)," naming the Suras 
The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I have married her 
to you for what you know of the Qur'an ."
