Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: A person stood up and asked, O Allah's: Apostle! What clothes may be worn in the state of Ihram? The Prophet replied, Do not wear a shirt or trousers, or any headgear (e.g. a turban), or a hooded cloak; but if somebody has no shoes he can wear leather stockings provided they are cut short off the ankles, and also, do not wear anything perfumed with Wars or saffron, and the Muhrima (a woman in the state of Ihram) should not cover her face, or wear gloves.
