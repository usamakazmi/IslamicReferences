Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, The first 
group of people who will enter Paradise, will be 
glittering like the full moon and those who will 
follow them, will glitter like the most brilliant 
star in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve 
nature, spit, or have any nasal secretions. Their 
combs will be of gold, and their sweat will smell 
like musk. The aloes-wood will be used in their 
centers. Their wives will be houris. All of them 
will look alike and will resemble their father 
Adam (in statute), sixty cubits tall.
