Narrated `Imran bin Husain:

A man said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Can the people of Paradise be known (differentiated) from the people of the Fire; The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "Yes." The man said, "Why do people (try to) do (good) deeds?" The Prophet said, "Everyone will do the deeds for which he has been created to do or he will do those deeds which will be made easy for him to do." (i.e. everybody will find easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been created).

حَدَّثَنَا آدَمُ، حَدَّثَنَا شُعْبَةُ، حَدَّثَنَا يَزِيدُ الرِّشْكُ، قَالَ سَمِعْتُ مُطَرِّفَ بْنَ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ الشِّخِّيرِ، يُحَدِّثُ عَنْ عِمْرَانَ بْنِ حُصَيْنٍ، قَالَ قَالَ رَجُلٌ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ أَيُعْرَفُ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ قَالَ ‏"‏ نَعَمْ ‏"‏‏.‏ قَالَ فَلِمَ يَعْمَلُ الْعَامِلُونَ قَالَ ‏"‏كُلٌّ يَعْمَلُ لِمَا خُلِقَ لَهُ ـ أَوْ لِمَا يُسِّرَ لَهُ‏"‏ ‏.‏

Narrated `Imran:

I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why should a doer (people) try to do good deeds?' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Everybody will find easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been created.'

حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو مَعْمَرٍ، حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ الْوَارِثِ، قَالَ يَزِيدُ حَدَّثَنِي مُطَرِّفُ بْنُ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ، عَنْ عِمْرَانَ، قَالَ قُلْتُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ فِيمَا يَعْمَلُ الْعَامِلُونَ قَالَ ‏ "‏ كُلٌّ مُيَسَّرٌ لِمَا خُلِقَ لَهُ ‏"‏‏.‏

Narrated `Abdullah: Allah's Apostle, the true and 
truly inspired said, (as regards your creation), 
every one of you is collected in the womb of his 
mother for the first forty days, and then he 
becomes a clot for another forty days, and then 
a piece of flesh for another forty days. Then Allah 
sends an angel to write four items: He writes his
 deeds, time of his death, means of his livelihood, 
and whether he will be wretched or blessed 
(in religion). Then the soul is breathed into his 
body. So a man may do deeds characteristic of the 
people of the (Hell) Fire, so much so that there is 
only the distance of a cubit between him and it, and 
then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, 
and so he starts doing deeds characteristic of the 
people of Paradise and enters Paradise. Similarly, 
a person may do deeds characteristic of the people 
of Paradise, so much so that there is only the 
distance of a cubit between him and it, and then 
what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, 
and he starts doing deeds of the people of the 
(Hell) Fire and enters the (Hell) Fire.
