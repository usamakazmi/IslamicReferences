Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah 's Apostle said, Treat 
women nicely, for a women is created from a rib, 
and the most curved portion of the rib is its upper 
portion, so, if you should try to straighten it, it 
will break, but if you leave it as it is, it will 
remain crooked. So treat women nicely.
