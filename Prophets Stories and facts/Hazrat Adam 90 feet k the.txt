Baab	Anbiya Alaih Salam Ke Bayan Main

Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, Allah 
created Adam, making him 60 cubits 
tall(90 feet/ 1080 inches). When 
He created him, He said to him, Go and greet 
that group of angels, and listen to their reply, 
for it will be your greeting (salutation) and the 
greeting (salutations of your offspring. So, Adam 
said (to the angels), As-Salamu Alaikum (i.e. Peace 
be upon you). The angels said, As-salamu Alaika 
wa Rahmatu-l-lahi (i.e. Peace and Allah's Mercy 
be upon you). Thus the angels added to Adam's 
salutation the expression, 'Wa Rahmatu-l-lahi,' 
Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble 
Adam (in appearance and figure). People have been 
decreasing in stature since Adam's creation.
