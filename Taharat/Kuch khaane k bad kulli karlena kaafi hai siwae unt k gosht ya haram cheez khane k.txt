Jabir b. Samura reported: A man asked the 
Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) 
whether he should perform ablution after 
(eating) mutton. He (the Messenger of 
Allah) said: Perform ablution it you so 
desire, and if you do not wish, do not 
perform it. He (again) asked: Should I 
perform ablution (after eating) camel's 
flesh? He said: Yes, perform ablution 
(after eating) camel's flesh. He (again) 
said: May I say prayer in the sheepfolds? 
He (the Messenger of Allah) said: Yes. 
He (the narrator) again said: May I say 
prayer where camels lie down? He (the Holy 
Prophet) said: No.

Narrated Suwaid bin Al-Nu`man:

In the year of the conquest of Khaibar I 
went with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) till we 
reached Sahba, a place near Khaibar, where 
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) offered the `Asr 
prayer and asked for food. Nothing but 
saweeq was brought. He ordered it to be 
moistened with water. He and all of us ate 
it and the Prophet (ﷺ) got up for the 
evening prayer (Maghrib prayer), rinsed 
his mouth with water and we did the same, 
and he then prayed without repeating the 
ablution.
