Quran 6:159 Surah Anam

Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects - you, [O Muá¸¥ammad], are not [associated] with them in anything. Their affair is only [left] to Allah; then He will inform them about what they used to do.

Quran 3:103 Ali Imran

And hold firmly to the rope1 of Allah all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allah upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided.
