5:33

Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.1
 Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran

As for those who repent before you seize them, then know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
