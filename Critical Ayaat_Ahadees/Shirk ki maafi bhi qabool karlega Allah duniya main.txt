Quran Sureh Furqan

25:68
˹They are˺ those who do not invoke any other god besides Allah, nor take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺ right,1 nor commit fornication. And whoever does ˹any of˺ this will face the penalty.

25:69

Their punishment will be multiplied on the Day of Judgment, and they will remain in it forever, in disgrace.

25:70


As for those who repent, believe, and do good deeds, they are the ones whose evil deeds Allah will change into good deeds. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful
