Narrated Abu Juhaifa: that he had bought a slave whose 
profession was cupping. The Prophet forbade taking 
the price of blood and the price of a dog and the 
earnings of a prostitute, and cursed the one who 
took or gave (Riba') usury, and the lady who tattooed 
others or got herself tattooed, and the picture-maker.
