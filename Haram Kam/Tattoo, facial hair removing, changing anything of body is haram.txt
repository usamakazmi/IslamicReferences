Narrated Ibn Mas`ud: Allah has cursed those women who 
practise tattooing or get it done for themselves, and 
those who remove hair from their faces, and those who 
create spaces between their teeth artificially to look 
beautiful, such ladies as change the features created 
by Allah. Why then shall I not curse those whom Allah's 
Apostle has cursed and who are cursed in Allah's Book 
too?
